            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Rabindranath Tagore was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian
                art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its
                "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse", he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the
                Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>
            <p>Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical
                poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as "the Bard of Bengal". A
                Pirali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan District and Jessore, Tagore wrote
                poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the
                pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.
                By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name.</p>
            <p>As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent anti-nationalist, he denounced the British Raj
                and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast
                canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs;
                his legacy endures also in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University.</p>
